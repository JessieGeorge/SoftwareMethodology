i think data should contain:
Folders of username, each folder containing that user's albums with photos.
One folder should be called stock. (i.e. the username is stock, it contains stock photos. stock photos should be given to all users.)
One folder should be admin? (i.e. the username is admin and password is admin. I don't think admin has any photos, but admin will have list of users.)
